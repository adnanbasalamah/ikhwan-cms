<h1>Dashboard</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Dashboard! You can only see this page when you are 
logged in. This would be the page in your application where you show 
users their most recent activity, anything they may have missed or 
give them links to other areas of your application. In this case we 
simply welcome you to the logged in area. I guess you could <?php echo 
anchor('account/logout', 'logout'); ?> if you wanted to?</p>
